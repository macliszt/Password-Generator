# Arduino Password Generator using 4x4 Keypad Module

## Overview
This project implements a **Password Generator** on an Arduino using a **4x4 Keypad Module** as the user interface. Users can define parameters like the length of the password and character types (letters, numbers, special symbols) through the keypad. Once generated, the password is displayed on a connected Serial Monitor or an optional LCD module.

This repository is designed for hobbyists, students, and professionals looking to learn about:
- Secure password generation techniques.
- Interfacing a 4x4 keypad with Arduino.
- Extending hardware functionality for practical applications.

---

## Features
- **User Input via Keypad:** Enter password parameters such as length and character set.  
- **Random Password Generation:** Combines uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters for secure passwords.  
- **Serial Monitor Output:** Displays the generated password for easy copying.  
- **LCD Support (Optional):** Add an LCD module to display the password directly on the device.  
- **Customizable:** Modify the code to set password constraints or adapt it to different hardware configurations.

## Components Required
- Arduino Board (e.g., Uno, Nano, Mega)
- 4x4 Keypad Module
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard
- (Optional) LCD Module with I2C Adapter

## How It Works
1. The user inputs the desired password length and character options via the 4x4 Keypad.
2. The Arduino generates a random password based on the selected parameters.
3. The password is displayed on the Serial Monitor or an LCD module.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Upload the provided code to your Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect the 4x4 Keypad Module to your Arduino as per the wiring diagram.
4. Open the Serial Monitor or connect an optional LCD to view generated passwords.
5. Input parameters (password length, character types) via the keypad and generate a password.

---

## Code Explanation
The provided code:
1. Uses the **Keypad.h** library for keypad interfacing.
2. Implements random password generation using Arduino's `random()` function.
3. Offers flexibility for adding/removing character sets.
4. Outputs passwords either to the Serial Monitor or an LCD module.

---

## Customization
- Modify the character sets (e.g., include/exclude special characters).
- Adjust the maximum password length as per your requirements.
- Integrate additional hardware like buzzers or LEDs for feedback.

---

## Applications
- **Password Management:** Generate strong, random passwords for personal or professional use.
- **Embedded Security Systems:** Use the generated passwords for locking/unlocking mechanisms.
- **Learning Project:** Ideal for beginners exploring Arduino and hardware interfacing.
